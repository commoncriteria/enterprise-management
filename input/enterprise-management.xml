  <section title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> 
      The scope of this PP-Module is to describe the security functionality of an Enterprise-Management product (EM) in terms of [CC] 
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is intended for use with the following Base-PPs:
      
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Protection Profile for Application Software Version 2.0</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      
      This Base-PP is valid because an EM is deployed as a software application on a general-purpose operating system.

      The PP-Module for Enterprise-Management (EM) covers the security functionality needed for an EM server to manage the configuration and behavior of endpoint systems in an enterprise setting, and providing monitoring and reporting capabilities for managed endpoints. <comment>potentially update this sentence or add a second one that clarifies why this is distinct from ESM EDR since they both involve "central server interfacing with endpoints".</comment>

        The boundary for Enterprise-Management includes 
        all processes, all modules, and libraries bundled with the product, to be run on a single server or multiple servers in a load balancing or failover configuration. This includes any local or remote management interface that is used to access the TOE for the purpose of configuration (whether of itself or of endpoints under the TOE's control), audit review, or any other supported administrative function. The TOE boundary includes communications channels with external entities. The platform operating system or execution environment
        upon which the TOE is executing is outside the scope of an EM evaluation. The figure below shows a sample deployment of an EM product within its larger operational environment, including remote systems for which it is responsible for managing.<comment>TBD</comment>.

        In a PP-Configuration that includes App PP, the TOE is expected to rely on some of the security functions implemented by the application 
        as a whole and evaluated against the Base-PP.
        The SFRs listed in this section are defined in the Base-PP and relevant to the secure operation of the TOE.
        This section describes any modifications that the ST author must make to the Base-PP SFRs to satisfy the required Enterprise-Management functionality.

        software-based application. The TOE boundary is simply extended to include the Enterprise-Management functionality

              The TSF shall alert the administrators in the event of any of the following:

              The expectation of this requirement is that the TOE has a mechanism to configure the heartbeat or reporting interval of systems or agents that are under its management. The inability of the system or agent to maintain this mechanism should be flagged by the TSF as anomalous behavior requiring further examination and potential corrective action. This necessarily includes a mechanism to identify the assets under management and when they are added or removed.</note>

              <h:p>
              Per <xref to="fel-gen-func-tsf"/>, audit data may be generated by the TOE, the platform, or both. If audit data is generated by the TOE, the TSF must have the ability to securely transmit this data to a remote entity. It may additionally store this data within the TOE boundary, in which case "the TOE itself" is selected and FAU_STG.2 must be included in the ST. Regardless of whether the TSF stores the audit data it generates within the TOE boundary, the TOE must always be able to securely transmit the audit data it generates to a remote entity. If audit data is generated by the platform, any secure local storage or secure remote transmission of this data is the responsibility of the platform.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
              Although the audit server is outside of the TOE, the TSF should still be able to support 
              mutual authentication. There are no requirements levied on the audit server, but the TOE should be 
              able to support TLS client certificate authentication. This way if the non-TOE audit server does 
              support verifying client certs, the TSF is able to make use of that.
              </h:p>
              <h:p>
                For distributed TOEs, each component must be able to export any audit data it generates across a
                protected channel. This may involve individual components independently transmitting
                audit data to the same environmental audit server via FTP_ITC.1, or it may involve
                one component of a distributed TOE aggregating audit data generated by other
                components prior to external transmission. In this case, the internal communication of audit data is protected via the mechanisms specified in FPT_ITT.1. The intent of this requirement in the context of a distributed TOE is that all audit data generated by all components of the TSF be transmitted to an environmental entity entirely through trusted channels, regardless of whether it is transmitted directly from the TSF to the operational environment or whether it is first transmitted to another part of the TOE.

            <note role="application">This requirement defines the permissions necessary to execute

              (i.e., Enterprise-Management) as defined in FMT_SMF.1/Internal as well as the TOE itself. 
              The ST author will define, for each claimed administrative function, any roles that are 
              authorized to perform this function. Roles may be predefined by the TOE, inherited from 
              an organizational directory, or custom based on privileges assigned to a role that the 
              TOE has the ability to create.<h:br/><h:br/>
              Role assignment in and of itself may not be sufficient to authorize a function; it may
              be the case that scoping rules also define the specific set of objects that the function
              may be performed against. Examples could include a user having the ability to reset only
              their own password while an administrator has the ability to reset any user's password,
              or two different users being able to perform the same Enterprise-Management functions 
              against two groups of external entities.

              and protection of the channel data from modification or disclosure.</title>
            <note role="application">The intent of the mandatory portion of the above requirement is to use the cryptographic 
              protocols identified in the requirement to establish and maintain a trusted channel with authorized IT entities 
              that the TOE interacts with to perform its functions.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              Protection (by one of the listed protocols) is required at least for communications with the IT entities managed by the TOE (whether those are systems that are managed using APIs provided by those systems by default, specialized agents running on systems that are designed for the purpose of interacting with the TOE, or both) and with
              the server that collects 
              the audit information. If it communicates with an authentication server (e.g., RADIUS), then the ST 
              author chooses "authentication server" in FTP_ITC.1.1 and this connection must be protected 
              by one of the listed protocols. If other authorized IT entities (e.g., NTP server) are protected, the 
              ST author makes the appropriate assignments (for those entities) and selections (for the protocols 
              that are used to protect those connections).<h:br/><h:br/> 
              To summarize, all communications with external entities that require protection of data in transit must be defined and must use one of the protocols specified in the requirement. At minimum, the TSF must communicate with external entities for the purpose of performing Enterprise-Management functions against them, and with a remote audit server for external storage of audit data. Additional channels are not required in order for the TOE to achieve its minimum required functionality, but if any such channels are implemented, appropriate protections must be provided for them.<h:br/><h:br/>
              
              The trusted channel uses IPsec, TLS, DTLS, or HTTPS as the protocol that preserves the confidentiality and integrity of external communications. The ST 
              author chooses the mechanism or mechanisms supported by the TOE.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If "IPsec as defined in the PP-Module for VPN Client" is selected, the TSF must claim conformance to a PP-Configuration that includes the VPN Client 
              PP-Module.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If HTTPS is chosen, FCS_HTTPS_EXT.1 must be included in the ST.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If the ST author selects "SSH as defined in the Functional Package for Secure Shell," the TSF must be validated against the FP for Secure Shell. It should be noted that due to constraints imposed by this PP that SHA-1 cannot be used.<h:br/><h:br/>
              If the ST author selects "mutually authenticated TLS as defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security" or "mutually authenticated DTLS as 
              defined in the Package for Transport Layer Security," the TSF must be validated against requirements from the Package for Transport Layer Security,
              with the following selections made:
              <h:ul>
                <h:li>FCS_TLS_EXT.1: 
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>either TLS or DTLS is selected depending on the selection made in FTP_ITC.1.1</h:li>
                    <h:li>either client or server is selected as appropriate</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
                <h:li>FCS_TLSC_EXT.1.1 or FCS_TLSS_EXT.1.1 (as appropriate):
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>The cipher suites selected must correspond with the algorithms and hash functions allowed in FCS_COP.1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>mutual authentication must be selected</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
                <h:li>FCS_DTLSC_EXT.1.1 or FCS_DTLSS_EXT.1.1 (as appropriate):
                  <h:ul>
                    <h:li>The cipher suites selected must correspond with the algorithms and hash functions allowed in FCS_COP.1.</h:li>
                    <h:li>mutual authentication must be selected</h:li>
                  </h:ul>
                </h:li>
              </h:ul> 
              Protocol, RBG, Certificate validation, algorithm, and similar services may be met with
              platform-provided 
              services.<h:br/><h:br/> 
              The requirement implies that not only are communications protected when they are initially established, but 
              also on resumption after an outage. It may be the case that some part of the TOE setup involves 
              manually setting up tunnels to protect other communication, and if after an outage the TOE attempts 
              to re-establish the communication automatically with (the necessary) manual intervention, there may be a window created 
              where an attacker might be able to gain critical information or compromise a connection.<h:br/><h:br/>

            <note role="application">This SFR implements one of the types of channel identified in the main selection for <xref to="fel-cpc-func"/>. The "joining component" in FTP_TRP.1/Join is the IT entity that is attempting to join the distributed TOE by using the registration process.<h:br/><h:br/>            
              The effect of this SFR is to require the ability for components to communicate in a secure manner while the distributed TSF is being created (or when adding components to an existing distributed TSF). When creating the TSF from the initial pair of components, either of these components may be identified as the TSF for the purposes of satisfying the meaning of "TSF" in this SFR.<h:br/><h:br/>
              The selection at the end of FTP_TRP.1/Join recognises that in some cases confidentiality (i.e., protection of the data from disclosure) may not be provided by the channel. The ST author distinguishes in the TSS whether in this case the TOE relies on the environment to provide confidentiality (as part of the constraints referenced in <xref to="fel-trp-func-tsf"/>) or whether the registration data exchanged does not require confidentiality (in which case this assertion must be justified). If "none" is selected, then this word may be omitted in the ST to improve readability.<h:br/><h:br/>             
              The assignment in <xref to="fel-trp-func-tsf"/> ensures that the ST highlights any specific details needed to protect the registration environment. Note that when the ST uses FTP_TRP.1/TRUSTPATH_JOIN for the registration channel then this channel cannot be reused as the normal inter-component communication channel defined in FPT_ITT.1.<h:br/><h:br/>

    The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included

    requirements in future versions of this PP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the
    ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in

  <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based"> As indicated in the introduction to
    this PP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the OS or its underlying
    platform) are contained in the body of this PP. There are additional requirements based on
    selections in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements
    below will need to be included. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This appendix includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this PP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    OS is still conformant to this PP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Inherently Satisfied Requirements" id="satisfiedreqs"> This
	appendix lists requirements that should be considered satisfied by products
	successfully evaluated against this Protection Profile.  
	However, these requirements are not featured explicitly as SFRs and should not be
	included in the ST.  
	They are not included as standalone SFRs because it would
	increase the time, cost, and complexity of evaluation.  This approach is permitted
	by <xref g="CC"/> Part 1, <h:b>8.2 Dependencies between components</h:b>.
    <h:br/>
	This information benefits systems engineering activities which call for inclusion of 
	particular security controls.  Evaluation against the Protection Profile
	provides evidence that these controls are present and have been evaluated.
